# HASH CODE 2019

Our attempt at [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/) 2019. The repo contains the code produced during the competition (after our 2 hour delayed start) and a few subsequent improvements made after the deadline.

**Note:** The original git log got a bit messy and this is the later edited git history. For reference the unedited history is on the [unedited branch](https://github.com/hexmod/hash-code-2019/tree/unedited)
